description:  Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in the School of Computer Science, Data and 
  Mathematical Sciences at Western Sydney University. My research focuses 
  on applying recent advancements in Natural Language Processing to 
  automatically align different disease classification systems, such as 
  the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). This ensures health 
  data remains consistent over time and across regions, addressing critical 
  challenges in longitudinal analysis and data interoperability.
